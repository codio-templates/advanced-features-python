Add a `Name` to your assessment. This will look like a "title" for the test. Leave some instructions for the student so they understand how to write their code to solve the problem.

## The Execution Section
Set the `LANGUAGE TYPE` as `Python`. In the field `LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT SUBTYPE` select `PyCodeStyle`. In the field `ADD CASE` type the path to the student file. Click the button `ADD CASE`. The student file should appear below the field. You can add multiple files to check if need be. Toggle `ALLOW PARTIAL POINTS` if you want the question to have partial points.
