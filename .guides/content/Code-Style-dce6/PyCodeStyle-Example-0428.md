# PyCodeStyle Example

Below is an example of an advanced code test with a style checker. The `TRY IT` button allows students to run their code as many times as they want prior to submitting it for a grade. This button calls the style checker so that students see feedback about their program. To submit their code for a grade, students click the `CHECK IT` button. The style checker checks the student work and passes the grade back to the LMS. An answer and rationale are also provided for the student.
