# PyCodeStyle Example


Below is an example of an advanced code test implementing a style checker:

- The `TRY IT` button allows students to test their code against PyCodeStyle, giving feedback on how their code aligns with best practices in the Python community. This feedback might include comments like 'line too long (82 > 79 characters)' or 'missing whitespace around operator'.
  
- The `CHECK IT` button is for final submission. The style checker checks the student work and passes the grade back to the LMS. An answer and rationale are also provided for the student.
