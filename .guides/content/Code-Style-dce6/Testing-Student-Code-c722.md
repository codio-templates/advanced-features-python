# Testing Student Code

![Try It](.guides/img/try-it.png)

If you want to give students the ability to  check their code for style but not have it count for a grade, then PyCodeStyle can be run from a button. This button is created in a similar manner to those buttons that run student code (replace `python3` with `pycodestyle --first`).


> **Note**: this button will not run the student code.


```
{try it}(pycodestyle --first student_code/code_style.py)
```
