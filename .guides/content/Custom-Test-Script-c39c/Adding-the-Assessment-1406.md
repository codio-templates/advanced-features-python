## The General Section
Add a `Name` to your assessment. This will look like a "title" for the test. Leave some instructions for the student so they understand how to write their code to solve the problem.

## The Execution Section
Leave the `LANGUAGE TYPE` as `Custom`. In the field `COMMAND` write the command to launch your custom grading script, or simply drag the file into the field from the file tree.

## The Grading Section
Enter the number of points for the problem. Toggle `DEFINED NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS` if you want to restrict students submissions. 

To give students immediate feedback, enable `SHOW RATIONALE TO STUDENT`. 
 - Fill in the box below with feedback you want to provide. 
 - Use [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to create a code block.

> **Note**: Allowing partial points has additional script requirements covered later in this guide.

## The Metadata Section
These assessments can be added to your organization's assessment library. Filling out the `Metadata` section with tags allows you and your colleagues to search for these assessments.
