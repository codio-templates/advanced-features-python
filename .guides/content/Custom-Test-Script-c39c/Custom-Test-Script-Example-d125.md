## Custom Test Script Example

Introducing the advanced custom code test! Below, we've broken down the process to help you understand the two primary functions available to students: testing their code and submitting it for grading.

- **TRY IT Button**: 
  - **Purpose**: Allows students to run their code without submitting it. This gives them an opportunity to debug and verify their solution.
  - **What It Does**: When clicked, the student's code is executed, and they can see the output. Note: It does **not** run any custom grading script, but simply executes the student's code.

- **CHECK IT Button**: 
  - **Purpose**: Students use this when they are ready to submit their solution for grading.
  - **What It Does**: Calls the custom grading script which evaluates the student's code and provides feedback. After checking, a grade is passed back to the LMS. An answer and rationale are provided to the student after this check.
