# The Custom Script

You can upload any grading scripts you already have to Codio. Scripts should be kept in the `.guides` folder so that students do not have access to them.

## Setup

[See Setup](open_file .guides/custom_test_script.py panel=0 ref="import" count=8)

The `os` module is used to create a file path to the student code, the `subprocess` module is used to run the student code, and the `sys` module is used to send the exit code to Codio.

The `path` variable contains the path to the student code, and the `file` variable contains the name of the student file. These two values are combined to create the `student_code` variable, which is used later on in the program. The `expected_ouput` variable should contain the expected output of what the student code should produce.

## Functions

[See Functions](open_file .guides/custom_test_script.py panel=0 ref="def" count=33)

Each function returns a boolean value and tests an aspect of the student code. The number of functions for you grading script will depend on the number of aspects you are evaluating from the student code.

## Feedback

[See Feedback](open_file .guides/custom_test_script.py panel=0 ref="if not" count=24)

Each function above is called separately. If they return `False`, then feedback should be given to the student as to why their code did not pass the code test. Output from `print` statements in an advanced code test can render HTML. So printing HTML tags will output HTML.

## Returning the Result

[See Result](open_file .guides/custom_test_script.py panel=0 ref="if check" count=5)

If all of the above the functions return `True`, then the student code is correct. A system exit of `0` lets Codio know that the solution is correct. A system exit of `1` tells Codio that the student code is incorrect.
