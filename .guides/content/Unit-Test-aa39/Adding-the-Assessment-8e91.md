## The General Section
Add a `Name` to your assessment. This will look like a "title" for the test. Leave some instructions for the student so they understand how to write their code to solve the problem.

## The Execution Section
Leave the `LANGUAGE TYPE` as `Python`. In the field `LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT SUBTYPE` select `UnitTest`. The `CASE` should be the student file to be tested. **Note**, the student file should be located in the `.guides` folder. The student code and test file need to be in the same directory. Use `python3` for the execution of the unit test, and set the working directory to `.guides/`. Toggle `ALLOW PARTIAL POINTS` if you want the question to have partial points.

## The Grading Section
Enter the number of points for the problem. Toggle `ONE ATTEMPT ONLY` if you want to restrict students to one submission. To give student rich and immediate feedback, toggle `SHOW ANSWER AND RATIONALE TO STUDENT`. Fill in the box below with a solution, and use [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to create a code block.
