# Testing Student Code

![Try It](.guides/img/try-it.png)

Students need the ability to run their code and check their work prior to submitting it for a grade. 

The `TRY IT` button allows students to run their code without submitting it. This gives them an opportunity to debug and verify their solution. When clicked, the student's code is executed, and they can see the output.

```
{try it}(python3 student_code/circle.py)
```

The above `TRY IT` button is a quick test of the students code file; it does not run the testing script. Refer to the **Comprehensive Feedback Button** section on page 4 for other options.

> **Note**: A simple solution that allows students the ability to test their code against the UnitTest script is to disable "Defined Number of Attempts" in the Grading section of the Advanced Code Test
