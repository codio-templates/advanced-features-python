# Unit Test Example

Below is an example of an advanced code test implementing the UnitTest Python testing framework.

- The `TRY IT` button allows students to run their code without submitting it. This gives them an opportunity to debug and verify their solution.
  
- The `CHECK IT` button is for final submission. It runs the UnitTest tests included in the testing script contained in the secure folder.

Use the button below to test your work before submitting it for a grade.
