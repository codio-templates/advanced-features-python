# Advanced Features in Python

This project walks you through setting up a variety of advanced code tests in Python.

## Table of Contents

1) Custom Test Script
1) Pycode Style
1) PyUnit
1) Partial Points Tests
1) Using X Servier

Each section contains the following:
* A working example from the student perspective. 
  * Students have the option for running the code test on its own to see if their code passes. This option is **not** connected to the LMS. This will not affect their grade, but they will not see the rationale and answer. 
  * The second option will auto-grade the student code and send the result to the LMS. They will see the rationale and answer.
* An example of the grading script used to evaluate student work.
  * The one exception to this is the style checker. There is no code for the instructor to write. PEP-8 is used for the style guide. This cannot be changed.
* Instructions on how to use the Advanced Code Test GUI to add the auto-graded assessment.
* Instructions on how to create a button that runs the code test but does not send the results to the LMS.
